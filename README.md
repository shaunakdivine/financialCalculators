# financialCalculators
Welcome to the Financial Calculators repository! This project contains a collection of Python-based calculators designed to assist with various financial computations and analyses. I created these seeing similar calculators online and replicating native Excel functions in a python environment. More for learning and applying financial concepts to a programming space. The calculators provided cover a range of topics including:

Dividend Discount Model (DDM): Calculate the intrinsic value of a stock based on its dividends.
Present and Future Value: Calculate PV or FV of lumpsum, annuity, perpetuity, or combinations.
Bond Value and Macaulay Duration: Calculate value of bond and its duration using user input.
Each calculator is implemented in Python and is designed to be user-friendly, with clear input and output specifications. You can easily integrate these calculators into your own financial analysis workflows or use them as standalone tools.
